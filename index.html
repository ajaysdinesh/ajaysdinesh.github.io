    <br>Hi there!
  </p>
  <p style="font-family:helvetica;font-color:#ffffff;font-size: 40px;text-align:center;">
    If you are reading this, you have reached this place because I wanted you to, or you are stalking me.
    Because this is just an aspiring developer's basecamp which has nothing meaningful to give you, yet. 
    The smiling guy you see up there is Ajay, he is an engineer, who will graduate from IIT Madras in 2020 with a Bachelor's degree
    in Engineering Physics. He reads, not very much, but not very less either, about topics that he feels he is interested 
    when he is browsing for a new book to read. Other than that, he watches TV series', sports and plays games like a normal person
    would do. He loves playing chess and Queen's Gambit is his favourite at the moment. He is a fan of board games. He can whistle,make 
    good as well as horrible puns, but would still make you laugh(Email for rishta). Most of his time otherwise is spent sleeping and thinking.
    He has also run teams, organised quite a lot of events in his college fests: Saarang and Shaastra. Oh, he loves comics too, go stalk him on Instagram 
    or ask him for some very good comic handles.
