    <br>Hi there!
  </p>
  <p style="font-family:helvetica;font-size: 40px;text-align:center;">
    If you are reading this, you have reached this place because I wanted you to, or you are stalking me.<br>
    Because this is just an aspiring developer's basecamp which has nothing meaningful to give you, yet. <br>
    The smiling guy you see up there is Ajay, he is an engineer, who will graduate from IIT Madras in 2020 with a Bachelor's degree<br>
    in Engineering Physics. He reads, not very much, but not very less either, about topics that he feels he is interested <br>
    when he is browsing for a new book to read. Other than that, he watches TV series', sports and plays games like a normal person<br>
    would do. He loves playing chess and Queen's Gambit is his favourite at the moment. He is a fan of board games. He can whistle,make <br>
    good as well as horrible puns, but would still make you laugh(Email for rishta). Most of his time otherwise is spent sleeping and thinking.<br>
    He has also run teams, organised quite a lot of events in his college fests: Saarang and Shaastra. Oh, he loves comics too, go stalk him on Instagram <br>
    or ask him for some very good comic handles.
